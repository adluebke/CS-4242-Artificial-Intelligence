The purpose of this project was to implement and observe the behavior and benefit one can expect from genetic algoritms being utilized to plug numbers into a function.

I can't recall the entire function used in the class, but genetic algorithms can be used with any functions, so switch out "var s" at line 129 of GA.cs to test it.
