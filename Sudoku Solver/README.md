The problem we are attempting to solve is to solve a Sudoku puzzle using a general
purpose programming language. In order to do this, we must design the solution such that the 
program will solve the puzzle using pseudo-intelligent methods; feigning human-like 
intelligence. The language I chose to do all this was C#.
