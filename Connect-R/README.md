The purpose of this assignment was to make a game similar to "Connect 4". Instead of a 7x6 game board where you connect 4, the application was to be able to handle any m x n game board where you connect R pieces to win. Additionally, an AI was to be developed which would play against the human. The key concept behind the development of the AI was the implementation of the MinMax algorithm.
