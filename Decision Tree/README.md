The purpose of this project was to utilize non-linear	data structures and searching to generate correct	agent. 

The task was to develop a program that reads in a behavior tree from an XML data file, build an in-memory representation of the behavior tree, and then provide a method by which the user can input an event to which the program will respond with the appropriate/correct response.
