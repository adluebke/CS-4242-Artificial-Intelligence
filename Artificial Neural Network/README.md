The purpose of this assignment was to develop an implementation of a multilayer feed forward neural network with backpropagation. This artificial neural network was to read a file with a list of integers which represent an 8x8 matrix with each element representing a “pixel”, and based on a value from 0 to 16, determine which number 0 through 9 is being drawn within the “picture”.
